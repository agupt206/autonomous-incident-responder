== RUNBOOK: Inventory Service High Latency ==
SYMPTOM: Slow response times / Latency > 500ms
ROOT CAUSE: Database CPU Pegged at 100% due to missing index.
CHECK: Use health tool to verify DB status.
FIX:
1. Run 'kubectl scale statefulset inventory-db --replicas=3'
2. Run 'db-admin flush-cache'
3. If CPU remains > 90%, escalate to DBA.
